	employee, and former contractor for the United States government who copied and leaked classified information from the National
	Security Agency (NSA) in 2013 without authorization. His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs, many run by
	the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments.

	20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii, and in early June he revealed thousands
	of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, and Ewen MacAskill. Snowden came to international 
	attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian and The Washington Post. Further disclosures were made by 
	other publications including Der Spiegel and The New York Times.
